Hello guys!

Here is a release of one of the scripts i customized. I'd like to share this with the FiveM community.
I hope i can improve this script with the help of others so please tell me of there is something i can do to make this script work better!
This is my first script where i tried to "fully" customize it to my preferences. It's way more realistic now in my opinion.

Before you thank me credits for the base script go to: https://github.com/Kuzkay/Kuzkay_Meth
I used his script with permissions to change it up. Also i implented "progressBars" in this script so you don't need any external scripts.
The original source for the progressBars can be found here: https://github.com/EthanPeacock/progressBars/tree/1.0

Kind regards,

KleurenDoof
