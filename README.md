### PROJECT CLOSED NO MORE SUPPORT ###



Hello guys!

Here is a release of one of the scripts i customized. I'd like to share this with the FiveM community. I hope i can improve this script with the help of others so please tell me of there is something i can do to make this script work better! This is my first script where i tried to "fully" customize it to my preferences. It's way more realistic now in my opinion.


Here are some things I added or changed:
- You need to build the methlab before you go on your trip now.
- After your trip you need to package (process) the meth before you sell it.

Here are some things im planning on making:
- Included selling NPC. (For now you have to use an external script to sell the meth)
- SQL file for all the items.
- Locale files for multiple translations for example; Dutch, German, English...
- When you are on your trip there will be some questions asked. The questions have effect on the amount meth you'll gather.
  I'm planning to make these questions also item relatable so for example if you say "Use tape to fix gasleak" You'll actually need tape otherwise your RV goes boom. :)
- Lots more but these are the main goals.


Before you thank me credits for the base script go to: https://github.com/Kuzkay/Kuzkay_Meth I used his script with permissions to change it up. Also i implented "progressBars" in this script so you don't need any external scripts. The original source for the progressBars can be found here: https://github.com/EthanPeacock/progressBars/tree/1.0

Do not change, and or publish my modification of Kuzkay's script without permissions! You are allowed to use it in your FiveM server. If you want to donate you can do that here: https://paypal.me/itsmeralphs

Kind regards,
